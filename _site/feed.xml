&lt;em&gt;I’ve had a Raspberry Pi 3 hooked up to my HiFi for several years providing audio streaming support for the various mobile devices in our home. While it has also served as a Plex media server using a 2TB USB drive, it has never been powerful enough to support video playback at reasonable quality. When I got a Raspberry Pi4 with 8GB RAM recently, I decided it was time for an upgrade.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Goal:&lt;/strong&gt; To seamlessly replicate the existing Pi3 set-up as a Plex Media Server and Airplay. To add video and audio playback using the Pi4 as a media client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stretch Goal:&lt;/strong&gt; To support HiFi quality Tidal music streaming locally. I.e. without using a mobile device streaming over Airplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hardware:&lt;/strong&gt; Raspberry Pi4 8GB, PiFi DAC+ 2.0 (This is a HiFi Berry clone), Argon NEO case, Rapoo K2800 Media Keyboard, Lexar S47 USB 256GB drive, Toshiba external 2TB drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software:&lt;/strong&gt; Manjaro ARM MATE Desktop Community edition, Plex Media Server, Plex Media Player, shairport-sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to detail the process of installing the operating system as there are many tutorials online that cover that process. However, I will say that I opted to install and boot off a USB drive rather than a Micro SD card because Micro SD cards are notoriously prone to corruption after sudden power loss whereas USB booted systems seem more stable. The availablity of fast USB3 drives means that they are also significanly faster than the internal MicroSD card reader as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opted for &lt;a href=&quot;https://manjaro.org/download/#raspberry-pi-4&quot;&gt;Manjaro ARM edition&lt;/a&gt; over Raspberry Pi OS, or Ubuntu because of the sheer scope of the Arch User Repository (The AUR). You could no doubt use PI OS or Ubuntu for this project, but you might have to get your hands dirty hunting around for 3rd party repositories or building from scratch. With the AUR, somebody has usually done the work for you and most apps have already been packaged for you. After flashing the Manjaro image to my USB drive on my main computer, I edited the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/boot/config.txt&lt;/code&gt; file while it was still plugged into my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#enable sound&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#dtparam=audio=on&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Enable HiFiberry DAC Standard/Pro&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dtoverlay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;hifiberry-dacplus
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dtparam&lt;/code&gt; line is commented out to disable the internal Pi DAC and 3.5mm output because it’s not very good. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dtoverlay&lt;/code&gt; line enables support for hifiberry-dacplus DAC. Mine is a third part clone, but it’s compatible with the HiFi Berry so the settings work. This is about the only text editing that you have to do. The rest can be done within the MATE desktop on the Pi. Note, while editing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;boot/config.txt&lt;/code&gt; file, you could also overclock your Pi from 1.5MHz to 2GHz, but seriously, for this application you don’t need to and the Pi get’s warm enough as it is while rendering audio or video. Plus, with the DAC hat installed, you don’t have many cooling options.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Fraser Smith</name></author><category term="Raspberry Pi" /><category term="Plex" /><category term="Plex Media Server" /><category term="Plex Media Player" /><category term="Manjaro" /><category term="Arm" /><category term="Arch Linux" /><category term="Tidal" /><summary type="html">I’ve had a Raspberry Pi 3 hooked up to my HiFi for several years providing audio streaming support for the various mobile devices in our home.

&lt;em&gt;Recently, I’ve taken to scanning a selection of subreddits on reddit.com covering my interests in tech, photography etc. Today, on a Linux subreddit I saw the comment that titles this post, “Arch is for Pros”. The Arch, in this case is &lt;a href=&quot;https://archlinux.org/&quot;&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt;, a notoriously tricky to setup Linux distro for those who like to live on the bleeding edge of technology (and Linux YouTubers). However, it got me thinking about the mis-appropriation and mis-use of the term “Pro”. Here are my thoughts on the matter.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many years ago I had a part-time job in a high-end HiFi equipment shop in Glasgow. We took pride in our approach, often lending equipment out to prospective customers to ensure that they found the right match for their musical appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we would get customers in the shop, HiFi magazine in hand, demanding to hear (even to buy, unheard) the device reviewed in said magazine because it was labelled “Professional”, therefore it must be good. Our showroom manager would gently bring them down to earth by asking “Do you want a car or a truck? The vast majority of professional drivers are truck drivers and bus drivers, they drive professional vehicles. Trucks or buses. Would you buy a professional driver’s vehicle?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting back to technology, the majority of professional use cases for Linux are in the running of servers: Database, Email, Web, etc. Whether they are running on-premise, in large managed datacenters or in “the cloud”, the two things that the professionals who run these servers value above all else are availability and security. It’s not uncommon to find servers on years-old operating systems and apps where only critical security patches have been applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working in cloud computing since 2013. I wrote software that ran a daily security and configuration audit on over a thousand managed servers. Most of those servers were running CentOS or &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/&quot;&gt;Amazon Linux&lt;/a&gt;, a significant minority were running Ubuntu. There may even have been a few running Debian, though I can’t remember ever coming across one. But one thing is certain, none were running Arch or Arch based distributions. Why is this? Put simply, Arch doesn’t support partial upgrades. There’s no way to just apply security patches. With Arch it’s all or nothing and, the longer you leave it, the higher the probability that something will break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a professional, it’s the stuff of nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use an Arch distro as my daily driver (&lt;a href=&quot;https://arcolinux.info&quot;&gt;ArcoLinux&lt;/a&gt;), does that make me un-professional? Perhaps. My laptop is not a mission-critical device. I like to tinker with it, installing things, tweaking things, breaking things. I know that I can completely re-install with a fresh OS and be back up and running in a couple of hours. However, that’s not a luxury afforded to the true professional Linux users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m reminded again of something else my showroom manager back in the HiFi shop used to say: “I’m not an audiophile. Audiophiles like to listen to equipment. I like to listen to music”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe Arch is for audiophiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the music.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Fraser Smith</name></author><category term="arch" /><category term="linux" /><category term="professional" /><category term="reddit" /><category term="fan boys" /><category term="centos" /><category term="amazon linux" /><category term="aws" /><category term="cloud" /><category term="ArcoLinux" /><summary type="html">Recently, I’ve taken to scanning a selection of subreddits on reddit.com covering my interests in tech, photography etc. Today, on a Linux subreddit I saw the comment that titles this post, “Arch is for Pros”.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/talisker2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Talisker Bottle Banner&quot; class=&quot;lft250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t normally feel the urge to write reviews for whiskies. Unfortunately, I have a very poor sense of smell and, therefore, by extension, a poor sense of taste. I’m envious of people who can detect subtle hints of vanilla and forest fruits with refreshing lemon overtones and a delicate smokiness in anything. I rarely can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one, however, is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the first gentle breath as my nose nears the glass, I’m taken back to childhood vacations on the North West coast of Scotland. Dried seaweed crunching underfoot at the high-tide line. Fishing in rockpools at low tide. The prickly machair on bare feet by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/lochinver/clachtoll/index.html&quot;&gt;Bay of Clachtoll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first sip takes me to the fishing harbour at Arbroath on Scotland’s East coast, near where my mother was born. The smell of the sea and the day’s catch fresh in my mind as my grand-parents indulge me in one more trip to the harbour to see the boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another sip and, as the smooth liquid travels around my mouth, I’m transported to my teenage years in the Scouts sailing Wayfarer dinghies in Loch Goil with the salt spray in my face and the feel of salty rime from the unruly ropes as sixteen-year-old me gave younger scouts their first taste of sailing. Often cold. Often wet. Always fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I swallow a third sip and, as the slightly peppery tail recedes, I’m reminded of my early career as a navigation engineer on survey vessels, of the ubiquitous smell of salt and the sea that cakes every ship, of weathering North Sea storms in the warmth of my cabin as the sea swallowed my window in a green dim, before releasing it again for its next mouthful. A harsher life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I can’t name the subtle flavours of this dram, but I will remember it as it has reminded me. Maybe I too have been made by the sea.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Fraser Smith</name></author><category term="whisky" /><category term="review" /><category term="memories" /><category term="nostalgia" /><category term="taliskerstorm" /><category term="talisker" /><summary type="html">“An intense Talisker, with a profoundly maritime character, like a warm welcome from a wild Hebridean sea”.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few days ago, I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKMaEAxPskU&quot;&gt;this post on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. It seemed like a fun idea so I decided to give it a try. (If you didn’t have time to watch the video, the assignment is to use a single prime lens for all of your personal photography for the month of November.)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I had to decide which lens to use on my Canon EOS-M5. I have five prime lenses at present. In order of focal length they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 Artisans 7.5mm f2.8 Fisheye&lt;/strong&gt;: This as a very distinctive lens. With its 7.5mm focal length (12mm in full-frame terms) it is, by far, the widest lens that I’ve ever owned. In the right situation, it gives a great perspective, but, hmmm, not for everyday use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canon EF-M 22mm f2.0&lt;/strong&gt;: This highly regarded prime lens is light, unobtrusive, and, with its 35mm equivalent focal length would seem the ideal choice for city life and the inevitable street photography shots. But, it’s a bit boring, not a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sigma 30mm f1.4&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a lovely lens. It’s fast, it’s sharp, at 48mm equivalent focal length it harks back to the days when I first started photography when every camera was bundled with a 50mm f1.8 “standard” lens. I love this lens and it was my first choice for this challenge. But, yeah, it’s too easy to go for the first choice, where’s the challenge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 Artisans 35mm f1.2&lt;/strong&gt;: This is, by far, the cutest lens that I have. The retro styling of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Zeiss_Sonnar&quot;&gt;Sonnar&lt;/a&gt; inspired design looks great on any camera. It has zero electronics, just purely manual focus and aperture. However, there are situations where it suffers from a weird vignette. It looks great, but it’s a flawed beauty (and, of course, has to be manually focused, just like the old days).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canon EF 50mm f1.5 (nifty fifty)&lt;/strong&gt; This is my only EF prime lens. I use it with an adaptor on my EF-M mount. At the moment, its 80mm equivalent focal length is probably my favorite. Whenever I head out with this lens on my camera, I never fail to come back with some satisfying images. It would seem that this lens is a good candidate for this challenge. But there we go again, where’s the challenge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve decided, if you haven’t already worked it out, to go with the flawed but cute 7 Artisans 35mm f1.2. It’s a manual focus lens. I hope that that will force me to take some more time to “get it right”, to think more about composition and the basics of photography. To get away from the “running and gunning” method that quick autofocus and seemingly unlimited storage encourages. In keeping with the retro nature of the lens, I’ve decide to try (no promises) and stick to black and white images for the duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I need to get out and shoot. I’ve taken my first two photos already, in and around the apartment (itchy finger syndrome). Here they are. I’ll post subsequent images here and on the usual culprits (Flickr and Twitter)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have been following my sporadic posts about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tramfishers.com/2019/10/17/a-life-in-cameras-1&quot;&gt;Camera Life&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll be aware that I’ve been a camera owner (and therefore a hobbyist photographer) for over fifty years. In that time, I have only managed to photograph lightning successfully twice. Each time I used a different technique and each time I succeeded… eventually.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first thirty years of my photography hobby I shot with 35mm film. Even trying to photograph lightning would be a very wasteful and costly endeavor. Living in the UK didn’t help, lightning just isn’t that common. Later, when I started traveling and spending more time in the tropics I did see more storms, but I was usually working offshore so trying to photograph lightning could easily have used up my whole trip’s film supply with no hope of replenishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until the advent of digital photography in the late twentieth century that photographing lightning became feasible. Even then it took another ten years or so before the right combination of location, climate, and vantage point enabled my first attempt at capturing lightning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;page-subtitle&quot;&gt;First Attempt, August 2010&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/lightning2010.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lightning Flashes Across The Sky, August 2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, we moved to Shanghai. Our apartment, on the twentieth floor, has a good view south towards the Huangpu River. I was using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dpreview.com/products/ricoh/compacts/ricoh_grdigital3&quot;&gt;Ricoh GRDIII&lt;/a&gt; camera at this time. The little Ricoh certainly wasn’t the ideal camera for this challenge. However, it did have some redeeming features that made capturing the shot easier, if not predictable. After a few failed attempts trying to time my shutter presses with flashes of lightning, I resorted to automation. The Ricoh had a very flexible manual focusing system for a compact camera so I was able to manually focus on infinity and disable the inevitable hunting for focus that would result from trying to use autofocus. I then configured the built-in interval timer to take one shot every five seconds. I walked away and left it on a table-top tripod shooting. I can’t remember whether the SD card filled up or the battery ran out first. However, by the time it stopped shooting, the storm was over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On loading several hundred shots into my computer, I had the one keeper and several near misses. I’ve reprocessed the original raw file with my current iPad Pro workflow and I’m pleased to see that it looks even better now than it did ten years ago. Not bad for a ten-megapixel compact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technique: Manually focus on infinity, interval shooting at five seconds, hope that you get lucky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;page-subtitle&quot;&gt;Second Attempt, August 2020&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.picfair.com/pics/011819435-lightning-over-shanghai&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/lightning2020.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lightning Flashes Across The Sky, August 2020&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to this year, almost exactly ten years after the first image. Of course there have been many thunderstorms in the intervening years, but none seem to have coincided with me being here to shoot, night-time, and being visible from the southern side of our building. I’m now using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dpreview.com/products/canon/slrs/canon_eosm5&quot;&gt;Canon EOS-M5&lt;/a&gt; mirrorless camera. The M5 is a much more capable camera, especially when paired with the 11-22mm wide-angle zoom. However, it doesn’t support interval shooting so the lazy option I used before wasn’t available this time (I could have used the Canon EOS app to set this up, but it’s not something I use often so I didn’t want to waste time). Instead, the M5 has a reasonably fast multiple shot burst rate of about nine frames per second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that there is often a short pre-flash with some lightning bolts. By setting the lens to manual focus on infinity, again, to eliminate autofocus hunting, I was often able to press and hold the shutter when I first saw a flash and then shoot a burst over the next second or two capturing any subsequent forks of lightning. With a bit of practice, this method was more successful than the previous method and resulted in more successful captures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image above is a composite of two consecutive images about 100ms apart. The first caught the start of the fork as the bolt of lightning shot down from the top left. The second caught the caught multiple branches seeking an earth point. I stacked these two images in Affinity Photo on my iPad Pro and then finished the processing in Pixelmator Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technique: Manually focus on infinity, set the camera to burst shooting, and press and hold the shutter down when you think there’s going to be a fork.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither of these methods is particularly reliable. You will end up with hundreds of exposures of dark skies or glowing clouds. You will also miss some beauties and capture some boring strikes. Such is life. However, if you persevere you can get results.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Fraser Smith</name></author><category term="tutorial, photography" /><category term="writing" /><category term="write52" /><category term="tutorial" /><category term="photography" /><category term="weather" /><category term="storm" /><category term="lightning" /><summary type="html">If you have been following my sporadic posts about Camera Life, you’ll be aware that I’ve been a camera owner (and therefore a hobbyist photographer) for over fifty years.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’d never join a club that would allow a person like me to become a member.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;― Groucho Marx&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About fifteen years ago, I discovered that I enjoyed writing. I think I discovered it most when a popular blog shared one of my posts, and I experienced the frisson of a post gaining ten thousand views in twelve hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years later, I had relocated to Shanghai and had an educational startup. I was writing weekly blog posts for this company and enjoying the process. Late in 2010, a twitter friend, (hi &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zee&quot;&gt;@zee&lt;/a&gt;), posted that his company was looking for somebody in Asia to write about tech subjects from Asia. I jumped at the opportunity. While I had worked in the publishing industry for thirteen years, it was in a technical role. I wasn’t a trained journalist. But I enjoyed writing. I felt I could do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenextweb.com&quot;&gt;TNW&lt;/a&gt; in the autumn of 2010 as its “Asia Editor”. How cool is that? An editor. Me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In part, in the beginning, I suffered from imposter syndrome, &lt;em&gt;I wasn’t a real writer&lt;/em&gt;. Luckily the team was great and helped the new boy out. However, what I couldn’t get used to was the writing to order. I was expected to publish at least three stories a day, five days a week. The stories didn’t have to be too long but I found the pressure incredible. Especially on Mondays. Tech news usually moves to US West coast time. On Mondays in Asia, not much tech stuff happens until, well, Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other problem was that, before TNW, I wrote about things that interest me. I still do. Working for TNW, there were times when a story came up that had to be written and published within fifteen minutes (to beat &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com&quot;&gt;Techcrunch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mashable.com&quot;&gt;Mashable&lt;/a&gt;). Even if the subject matter was of little interest to the average techie (or me), the scoop was the goal, not the subject. I struggled with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months later I was relieved when TNW sacked me (Thanks @zee!). It is the only time in my career that I’ve been sacked and I never expected to feel so happy about it. But I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the present. I still like writing, on my terms, about subjects that interest me. I’ve been meaning to get back into it more regularly so, last year, I started this site, tramfishers.com (yes, it’s a stupid name, I know. Too late now.), to focus more on written pieces as opposed to the photos that I usually post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a friend started posting with the #Write52 hashtag. I investigated and found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.write52.com/&quot;&gt;Write52&lt;/a&gt; project where people try to write and publish one post per week. It sounded like fun. This also coincided with the first weeks of lockdown in China so I also had something to write about. Three months later, and it’s not so much fun anymore. I missed last week completely, despite having three good ideas for posts. The previous week, my whole post was a haiku. The problem is that the drive to come up with something every week has become a chore. It’s no longer fun. So, I’ve decided that this will be my final regular #Write52 post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I going to stop writing? No, after all, I’ve still got three good ideas to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just that I’ll be writing on my terms when I want to. No pressure. Maybe I’ll even tag some future posts as #Write52 in the cheeky hope that I might garner a few views from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Fraser Smith</name></author><category term="writing" /><category term="write52" /><category term="tnw" /><category term="TheNextWeb" /><summary type="html">“I’d never join a club that would allow a person like me to become a member.” ― Groucho Marx</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Springtime Haiku</title><link href="https://www.tramfishers.com/2020/04/09/springtime" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Springtime Haiku" /><published>2020-04-09T13:40:00+08:00</published><updated>2020-04-09T13:40:00+08:00</updated><id>https://www.tramfishers.com/2020/04/09/springtime</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.tramfishers.com/2020/04/09/springtime">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/tree-pollen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tree pollen&quot; /&gt;
