&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first of a series of posts dedicated to the many cameras that I have owned over the years. While some of the posts may focus on my thoughts the camera itself, for others, I hope to dig up some remote memories and anecdotes from the time when I owned it.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around about 1968, my parents gave my sister and I Kodak Instamatic cameras as Christmas presents, I was five years old and it was my first real camera. My dad was a keen photographer and had been using his Kodak Retina 1b since 1956 and mum also had a slightly more advanced Instamatic. We were a true Kodak family in those days. It took &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/126_film&quot;&gt;126 cartridge film&lt;/a&gt; and I still remember the agonizing wait for the exposed films (12 exposures) to return from the developers. The pictures were square, but there were special offers at that time that would print a 4” print and two 2” prints of each image on a single 6”x4” print. I’ve no idea what the point was, but we thought it was cool at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first memory of actually using a camera is probably from the following spring or summer. I can remember that there had been few opportunities to use our Christmas present cameras up until then, so, at the first sign of some warmer weather, the whole family piled into our Vauxhall Viva and headed off to Arbroath on the Scottish east coast. It was lambing season. The fields were full of happy gambolling lambs. We soon pulled over for a photo opportunity. My sister and I stood, cameras at the ready, determined no get the shot and not waste any of our precious twelve exposures. Even in those days, I was already on the lookout for something different, something that would give my image a certain je ne sai qua. The opportunity soon presented itself and I snapped my first masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mummy, Mummy”, I said, tugging at her sleeve, “I took a photo of a lamb sitting down.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lambs don’t sit down”, she answered patiently, “it must have been…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slowly, it dawned on me. I felt my face redden with embarrassment. My first photographic masterpiece. Indeed, the earliest photographic experience that I remember to this day, was of a sheep having a pee.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>FrasSmith</name></author><category term="cameras" /><category term="photography" /><category term="gas" /><category term="kodak" /><category term="instamatic" /><category term="biographical" /><summary type="html">This is the first of a series of posts dedicated to the many cameras that I have owned over the years.

For any photographer, uploading images to Instagram can be a chore as a typical workflow would be to transfer files from camera to computer, process files, export to jpeg and then, find some way to transfer the jpeg files onto a phone to upload to Instagram. It’s almost as if Instagram doesn’t really want serious photographers on its platform.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
There are a few tutorials online that outline various methods to work around this limitation. A common solution is to install some form of Android emulator or VM and then install the Instagram app there. This is over complicated and a huge resource drain for such a single use requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method described here is much simpler and uses an app, &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, that you probably already have installed on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most users will be familiar with the Instagram app on iPhone or Android devices. However, what many don’t realise is that the app is not mandatory. You can use the Instagram web site on any mobile browser too. The site automatically detects that it’s running in a mobile browser and includes the toolbar, including the upload button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/instamenu.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be great if you could make the Instagram site on your desktop browser think that it’s running on a mobile? Well, you can. Every browser sends a unique identifier to each website that it accesses, describing the platform that it’s running on. This identifier, called the User-Agent, is what the site uses to decide whether it’s responding to a mobile or a computer. There are extensions available for most popular desktop browsers that will allow you to manually set the User-Agent string to any value you want, allowing your desktop browser to identify as a mobile device if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Chrome, one such extension is &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-for-c/djflhoibgkdhkhhcedjiklpkjnoahfmg&quot;&gt;User-Agent Switcher for Chrome&lt;/a&gt;. Install this extension and you’ll be able to configure it to use a User-Agent string for a mobile device whenever you access Instagram. Instagram will then serve up its mobile site complete with toolbar and function exactly as if its running on a mobile device. Quick, simple and no need to emulate anything.&lt;/p&gt;

Have you ever wondered why some people have to be mobile when they’re on their mobiles, or doodle in meetings, or continually play with a stress ball? You might think that they are not paying attention, but, in fact, the opposite may be true. The reason may be linked to a disorder commonly associated with kids but rarely applied to adults’ behaviour, Attention Deficit Disorder or ADD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term ADD is a misnomer. It is not really a deficit of attention. It would be better described as an executive disorder. People who suffer from ADD do not have a deficit of attention; they just have a problem controlling their attention and their working memory (the memory that we all use to buffer information while we process it) and can be very easily distracted. This can lead to a loss of focus and poor organisation skills. However, regardless of the accuracy of the name, as many papers and books have already been written on the subject it isn’t going to change any time soon so ADD it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADD is not a binary condition it is a spectrum disorder. That means that everyone, you included, has ADD to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
