For any photographer, uploading images to Instgram can be a chore as a typical workflow would be to transfer files from camera to computer, process files, export to jpeg and then, find some way to transfer the jpeg files onto a phone to upload to Instagram. It’s almost as if Instagram doesn’t really want serious photographers on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few tutorials online that outline various methods to work around this limitation. A common solution is to install some form of Android emulator or VM and then install the Instagram app there. This is over complicated and a huge resource drain for such a single use requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method described here is much simpler and uses an app, &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, that you probably already have installed on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most users will be familiar with the Instagram app on iPhone or Android devices. However, what many don’t realise is that the app is not mandatory. You can use the Instagram web site on any mobile browser too. The site automatically detects that it’s running in a mobile browser and includes the toolbar, including the upload button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/instamenu.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be great if you could make the Instagram site on your desktop browser think that it’s running on a mobile? Well, you can. Every browser sends a unique identifier to each website that it accesses, describing the platform that it’s running on. This identifier, called the User-Agent, is what the site uses to decide whether it’s responding to a mobile or a computer. There are extensions available for most popular desktop browsers that will allow you to manually set the User-Agent string to any value you want, allowing your desktop browser to identify as a mobile device if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Chrome, one such extension is &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-for-c/djflhoibgkdhkhhcedjiklpkjnoahfmg&quot;&gt;User-Agent Switcher for Chrome&lt;/a&gt;. Install this extension and you’ll be able to configure it to use a User-Agent string for a mobile device whenever you access Instagram. Instagram will then serve up its mobile site complete with toolbar and function exactly as if its running on a mobile device. Quick, simple and no need to emulate anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered why some people have to be mobile when they’re on their mobiles, or doodle in meetings, or continually play with a stress ball? You might think that they are not paying attention, but, in fact, the opposite may be true. The reason may be linked to a disorder commonly associated with kids but rarely applied to adults’ behaviour, Attention Deficit Disorder or ADD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term ADD is a misnomer. It is not really a deficit of attention. It would be better described as an executive disorder. People who suffer from ADD do not have a deficit of attention; they just have a problem controlling their attention and their working memory (the memory that we all use to buffer information while we process it) and can be very easily distracted. This can lead to a loss of focus and poor organisation skills. However, regardless of the accuracy of the name, as many papers and books have already been written on the subject it isn’t going to change any time soon so ADD it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADD is not a binary condition it is a spectrum disorder. That means that everyone, you included, has ADD to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
