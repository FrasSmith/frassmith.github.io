Welcome to tramfishers.com, a site set aside for writing, sharing, grumbling and (maybe) ranting.

I'm Fraser Smith, a fifty mumble mumble something year old developer and amateur photographer living in Shanghai. I'm also responsible for the @Literaverse and @BardInsults twitter bots.

Why TramFishers? Let's just say that it has me very confused. SmarterFish was already taken and I didn't really fancy ShitFarmers (it's an anagram).
