Welcome to tramfishers.com, a site set aside for writing, sharing, grumbling and ranting (maybe).

I'm Fraser Smith, a fifty mumble mumble something year old developer and amateur photographer living in Shanghai.

Why TramFishers? Let's just say that I am a bit confused about that, but SmarterFish was already taken and I didn't really fancy ShitFarmers (it's an anagram).
