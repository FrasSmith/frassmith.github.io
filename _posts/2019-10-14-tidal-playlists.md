title: TIDAL Automatic Playlists

I was re-acquainting myself with The Stranglers' _Aural Sculpture_ album this afternoon on [TIDAL](https://tidal.com/browse/album/673817). When TIDAL finishes playing an album, it automatically generates a playlist of similar artists and plays that next.

In the end, I rediscovered several eighties bands and musicians that I'd completely forgotten.

Nice one TIDAL.
