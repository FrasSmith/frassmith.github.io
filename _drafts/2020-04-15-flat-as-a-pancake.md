Many years ago I read an article in a photography magazine that attempted, with some success, to prove that the Earth was flat. I suspect it was the April edition of the magazine. The article was thought-provoking and succeeded within certain boundaries. It has stuck with me since then.

Of course, with the advent of social media, there has been a resurgence of flat-earth theories. One might even call it an, ahem, "global" phenomenon.

It's well past time to roll out this theory again.

_Warning #1: There may be some mathematics ahead. I'll try to keep it to a minimum._

_Warning #2: If you believe that the Earth is flat and that I am somehow going to prove your ridiculous belief. Then you are a moron and should stop reading right now. You'll only get more confused._

The title of this post may well give away the main premise of this article. "As Flat as a Pancake." If you want to demonstrate a characteristic of something, then one good method is to compare it to something that is known to exhibit that characteristic. Don't worry, I'm not going to compare the Earth to a pancake (yet) that approach would be crepe (sic). However, it might be interesting to first investigate the flattest things currently known to us and consider just how flat those things are.

_Math Alert: It's coming soon._

_Moron Alert: Are you still here?_

The flattest items known are optical filters for cameras and astronomical telescopes, and silicon wafers used for fabricating electronic circuits. However, even if these are extremely flat, they are still manufactured to meet certain tolerances and these tolerances are measurable and they are not _pefectly_ flat.

If we consider a lens filter, constrained at the edge by a circular frame, then the point that most deviates from the plane is likely to be near the centre of the filter. This means that we have a disk where the centre deviates slightly from the plane. This could be seen as an area on the surface of a sphere. If that's confusing, imagine drawing a circle on a ball and cutting it out. That would be an exaggerated version of your filter.

We can simplify this further by drawing a diameter across our circle and taking a cross-section. This results in a line, but not a straight line because we have a tiny error. This slightly curved line can be mapped to an arc on the circumference of a circle. If we have an arc, we can calculate the radius of that circle.

This image demonstrates an exaggerated example where `W` is the diameter of the filter and `H` is the displacement of the centre from a perfectly flat plane. With this information, there is a simple formula that we can apply to calculate the radius of the circle. That formula is:


## <center>r =  H/2 + W<sup>2</sup>/8H</center>

And that's it for the maths. Let's now consider what happens when we slot various real-world figures into that formula, after all, the point of this post is to compare very flat things.
