_I didn't expect my Apple Watch Series 2 to last as long as it did. When I bought it over four years ago, I assumed that it would follow the usual route that mobile products follow. A couple of years of able performance followed by a steady decline in battery health until the off-charge life becomes too short. That would be the time to purchase a new one.

Read on to find out why I replaced it with a Xiaomi Watch Color and my thoughts on that watch._
